#### Tradera Buyer Protection

Tradera, a Swedish online marketplace for auctions and retail, wanted to promote their new buyer and seller protection programs. They had many capabilities, but needed to formulate the right offering and messaging. I drove the research and design for this project.

#### Background

Tradera wanted to add more protections for buyers and sellers, so it partnered with Klarna, a payment startup that offers many different payment options, additional buyer/seller protection, and escrow. Combined with traceable shipping and insurance from DB Schenker, we could now offer door-to-door protection.

This was set to become a major part of our brand, being a lynch pin of marketing to win customers and encourage current ones to buy and sell more items of higher value. Due to circumstances, we had a *very* short time frame to ship it, so we had to think and move quickly.

#### Initial ideation

I sketched out rough mockups of all the possible places this feature could be seen on an end-to-end experience for a buyer and a seller. I then ran them by several groups for gut checks - first the other designers, then other employees who also frequently bought and sold on Tradera, then back- and front-end engineers, and finally senior leadership. 

These sketches were by no means the final design, and I made that clear from the very beginning. The idea was to equip other people to start thinking about this feature as early as possible, and at the time it was most open to change. That way, they would have plenty of time to come up with better ideas, or even start estimation. 

#### The logo

I researched how other brands handled this sort of feature. Although there are many ways to denote security, most lend themselves to specific usage. For example, a lock usually denotes SSL connections for secure banking. A shield is used quite often for consumer protection, so we made a call to run with it.

I mocked up a placement image with our initial project name (Tryggare Tradera, or ‘Safer Tradera’), then contracted the final visual design of the logo to our go-to agency, S+Z Design. We iterated on the logo in parallel with the further research on naming.

#### Naming research

**Variations**. First, I engaged our Product Marketing Manager to research the different ways customer protection programs position themselves, and to work up 5-6 possible slogans. These included a few of our best shots, as well as two ‘negative hypotheses’ that would double-check some ideas that we felt had misleading connotations.

**Prototypes**. Next, I then mocked up paper prototypes containing the logo candidates in a variety of different applications, each designed to gauge reactions at critical touch points in the experience.

**Study guide**. I then wrote a short guide on interview etiquette and best practices and attached them to the prototypes. (I facilitated customer research at Intuit under the guidance of professional researchers for several years, so I know enough to run a simple project like this.)

**Kick-off**. Our team then recruited/drafted a group of 10 Tradera employees across a range of domains - from PR, engineering, customer support, even the CEO - and tasked them with interviewing up to 5 people each over the weekend. I ran through the guide, demonstrated some techniques to handle difficult situations, handed them the packets and scheduled the follow-up.

#### Naming research conclusions and take-aways

**Follow-up**. The following Monday morning, we met to share our experiences. (Note: in Sweden, it was mandatory to provide coffee and cardamom rolls.) We took turns sharing our findings. As each person spoke, I could see everyone else drawing parallels to the things they heard themselves. By the time it got to the fifth person, the big patterns were becoming clear. By the last person, the correct choice was obvious to everyone.

**A-ha moments.** Everyone had at least one customer perspective that surprised them. For example, the CEO talked to a journalist who told us which names lent themselves best to article headlines. Another told us that another name (one of the negative hypotheses) had huge legal implications that would have put us on the hook for responsibilities that we never intended to imply.

**Empathy.** The end result was that every single person in the room had made a personal, emotional connection with the people we were intending to help with this feature. The ten decision makers had the benefit of hearing the qualitative responses of over 30 customers, in a setting that allowed them to ask deeper and all benefit from the answers. 

**Shared vision.** The secondary benefit was that everyone was now also equipped to be a good collaborator from that point on. Everyone producing content - from my messaging in the UX to the deeper documentation – had a group of people that could provide informed critique. And, since everyone had a shared perspective,  the decision making process ran smoothly.

#### Results

**Pared down offering.** We only built half of what we originally thought we needed. It seems sellers don’t really feel the need to have dedicated protection, due to a combination of factors. For example, few sellers are troubled by the possibility of buyer fraud, because every payment method in Sweden is so fast and secure that they always get their money before they ship. So, ‘Seller Protection’ was nixed.

**Strong reception.** As far as how well Buyer Protection succeeded, I’m not at liberty to share exact details, but it accomplished every goal we aimed for. The adoption rate was high, new customers felt better about selling on Tradera (even when they didn’t use the feature), sellers used the feature on the items we anticipated they would, and customers that bought things with Buyer Protection spent more and were happier about their purchases.
