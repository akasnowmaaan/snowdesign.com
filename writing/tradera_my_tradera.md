#### My Tradera

This is the redesign of the ‘home’ where Tradera sellers and buyers manage their transactions, payment, and shipping. This was a collaboration between multiple design and product teams. I drove strategy, created interaction design, and contributed art direction.

#### Early analysis

We had several months of lead time for this project, so we did our due diligence from all angles.

**What features do customers actually use**? The previous My Tradera had a decade's worth of feature creep and odd edge cases. We figured out what to keep and what to cut with a combination of customer interviews, traffic analysis, internal review, and low fidelity prototyping.

**What does mobile first mean for us**? Tradera had a huge influx of mobile users (growing 75% in two years), so we wanted to optimize for those devices.

**What are the implications for desktop**? What happens when we have more space? Do we just display more stuff, or do we actually take steps to optimize for desktop? And if so, how?

**How about buying vs. selling**? Although buyers had fully embraced mobile, the vast majority of selling still happened on desktop. Was that a product of the interface, or natural inclination?

#### Initial ideation

Mathias and I kicked it off with an offsite ideation session. We then took the preliminary concepts, plastered them all over the walls, then started grabbing people and getting them to riff off our ideas. Later, we ran a structured brainstorming session. 

We found everyone was passionate about the project. The way they engaged with us told us they'd been thinking deeply about customers, and the brainstorming sessions netted us some strong interaction patterns that eventually became fundamental parts of the interface.

#### Formulating our design principles

**The problem**. After a few weeks, we had a good understanding of what our customers were asking for, but internally there was some confusion and consternation. This was such a clean slate, we had an immense set of new capabilities at our disposal, and everyone was obsessing about doing the right thing, but the teams didn't have clear goals.

**Kick-off**. So, with Mathias' help, I drafted set of design principles, driven by a combination of our internalized philosophy, business goals, time/resource realities, and aspirations. We distributed them framed with 'here is what we've been hearing, here's a notion of where we think we need to go, everyone tear it to shreds and see if it holds up.' 

**Feedback**. We then got feedback in every way we could - we made sure every single person who would be working on the project had a voice in shaping them. We also made it abundantly clear we needed frank and honest critique; this document was supposed to become a rallying cry.

**The result**. We did the right thing - design principles were mostly greeted with a sigh of relief. The suggestions that did come in were small, mostly clarifications and pointing out gaps, and were easily incorporated. After the principles were formalized, the chaos immediately stopped and teams started working with a renewed sense of focus.

#### Prototyping, iteration and feedback

We started prototyping with mobile clickable prototypes created in Balsamiq and Marvel. We quickly progressed to live alphas and betas, with a steady, rapid improvement fed by customer feedback.

**The 'To Do' list**. The entire reason customers come to My Tradera is to handle time-sensitive tasks like paying for purchases and shipping sold items. So, we reorganized the experience around a task list ordered by chronology and urgency. Customers loved it and took to it immediately.

**The happy path**. The vast majority of sales and purchases follow a short, easy progression: pay then leave feedback, or get paid, ship, then leave feedback. We optimized around those common tasks, demoting edge cases slightly. It's a bold departure, but our old and new customers embraced it just the same.

[[ For mobile, we erred towards solving common tasks easily, and for desktop we erred towards enhancing power and productivity. ]]

**Mobile vs Desktop strategy**. Our mobile and desktop experiences have identical functionality. However, mobile skews towards simplicity, and desktop reveals more functionality up-front and adds productivity enhancements like batch processing. It makes the mobile experience feel simple and modern, while making desktop power sellers incredibly productive.

**Maintain familiarity**. Many of our sellers literally built their entire career around Tradera. For them, we wanted the My Tradera experience to feel like a clean, polished, improved version of what they have been using all along. We've asked them to stay with us through a lot of change, and we have plenty of time to experiment with smaller, more subtle innovations later on.

#### Results
 
**Productivity**. Our usability testing results validate our principles. People immediately get to work, accomplish their tasks more quickly than before, and enjoy the process.

**Feedback**. The feedback from our customers has been consistently strong and useful; rather than complaints, we've been getting suggestions on what they want to see next, which, in the vast majority of times, is exactly what's on the list to build next.

**Mobile/desktop**. We see strong positive feedback from mobile and desktop users. Our strategy of 'simple on mobile, powerful on desktop' works.

**Simplicity**. We eliminated a huge number of duplicate features, buttons and links from the experience. Nobody seems to miss them. We're very happy with it, and I look forward to the launch.

As of this writing, My Tradera is still in final beta, set to launch 3rd quarter 2016.
