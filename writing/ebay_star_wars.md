#### Star Wars on eBay

When Star Wars was released on BluRay, eBay gained exclusive rights for the launch. eBay created a fan portal, full of exclusive movies, concept art, and a curated set of Star Wars collectibles and memorabilia. I led design on three specific components of the launch.

#### Star Wars portal videos, trivia and concept art

The eBay.com/starwars portal was the central destination for the campaign. The portal visual design and overall layout was fully-baked by the time I got there, so I focused on the movie theater & trivia experience. Each day exclusive videos, trivia, and concept art were ‘unlocked’ to correspond to a movie in the saga, counting down to the Blu-ray release. 

I designed the movie section made it clear how many movies there were, how many were viewable now, and when to come back for the next 'unlocking'. The six trivia and concept art 'hot spots' on the page used animation and movement to tease there was something to be seen when moused over. The design harmonized with a wide variety of background art.

#### Home page countdown to launch day

During the week-long run-up to the launch, the home page and global navigation featured Star Wars characters peeking out from behind the logo - a position we internally refer to as the ‘doodle’. On launch day, when the Death Star appeared, and Darth Vader took over almost the entire home page.

For this part, I had to sift through the entire LucasFilm library to select the right set of images. (Has a designer ever told you how fun their job can be? This was one of those times.) After that, I composed, arranged, and typeset them in several different applications. 
 
#### Advertising

The Blu Ray launch was heavily promoted across every channel. We have a large variety of advertisement that happens across eBay.com, email marketing pieces, and partner websites.

I created a family of banner ads for every application, with several variations of messaging, translated into five different languages, and laid out for thirteen different banner sizes.

#### Results

This was a first for eBay, so we really didn't know what to expect as far as traffic, engagement, and other metrics. But it was considered a success, and the campaign definitely boosted sales for Star Wars memorabilia.

I'm very happy with the movie and trivia showcase. Our usability testers found every feature without prodding, we got kudos from LucasFilm for the quality of our work, and it was just great fun to be part of a cultural event.
