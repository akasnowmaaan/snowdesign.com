#### Design.ebay.com

I joined eBay just as the company was ramping up recruitment for user experience. To drive that, we created a new recruitment site that profiled our design leaders. I was chosen to contribute, so I provided art direction, photography, and design for the profile of Kevin Lee.

#### Art direction and photography

The goal of the site was to highlight the personality of the design leads to show potential employees the type of people they’d be working with. I was profiling Kevin Lee, Senior Design Manager. He gives an impression of being serious and composed, but has a whimsical side, as shown by thes blazing-orange remote-control Formula race car he drives around at work. 

That gave me an idea to use the race car to create a subtle reveal. I asked Kevin to bring a formal suit to work, and we did a photo shoot of him on the lawn outside our building. As a viewer scrolls down the page, it turns out the seriously-dressed man is having a blast with a cool toy. That's the message for potential hires; don’t let your initial impression of eBay fool you, we’re having a lot of fun!

#### The result

**We had a blast.** I was very happy with the final result, we both had fun with the whole process of creating it, and I contributed to a site that I was proud to send to potential hires.

**The site worked.** Several candidates (and even a few hires) specifically brought up the site when sharing reasons why they wanted to work at eBay.
