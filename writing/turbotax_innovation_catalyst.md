#### Intuit Innovation Catalyst

In 2010 the Tax Development organization - the programmers & accountants that build the internal logic of TurboTax - needed to revamp their build system. In my role as an Intuit Innovation Catalyst, I was one of the facilitators that led the project.

#### The initiative

The software build system for the tax code of TurboTax was stretched to the breaking point. It had grown complex, unwieldy, and fragile, due to the types of bugs, inefficiencies and workarounds that collect over time in any toolset that continues to 'work'.

Developers waiting too long for builds, and due to the opaque nature of the process, people were frequently 'breaking' the build which slowed everyone down ever more. Our goal was to make the system fast, transparent, and robust again, while teaching innovation practices to the team.

#### The scope of the task ahead

**Complexity.** The code base of TurboTax is among the biggest in all of software - it contains the logic of 70,000+ pages of Federal tax law, (plus who knows how many more for the 45 states), wrapped in a step-by-step interface, and published on web, iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows platforms. 

**Availability.** All of that is worked on simultaneously by hundreds of tax programmers and engineers across dozens of teams at multiple locations, each needing to build fully-testable versions of the software at any time - sometimes multiple times a day.

**Due diligence.** A system like that is unavoidably complex and deceptively interdependent, and the kind of changes we needed to make demanded rigor and caution. Measure twice, measure twice again, then cut. 

**Teamwork.** The initiate happened over 5-6 weeks, involving a cross-functional team with everyone from design, research, quality assurance, tax domain experts, engineering, and senior management. Everyone contributed, everyone took ownership.

#### The innovation catalyst process

**Kick-off.** The session framed the problem in human terms, reaffirmed our efforts were ultimately towards our customers, then modeled the best practices, tasks and behaviors the teams were to expect over the course of the project.

**Exercises.** The Innovation Catalyst program uses a methodology similar to the work of IDEO and Clayton Christensen, in that the focus is on iterative work to understand, break down, validate and re-prioritize until everyone is absolutely sure they are solving the right problems for the right people.

[[ Someone asked Kara and I, 'What are our success metrics'? We looked at each other, shrugged, and said: 'You tell us?' The looks people exchanged indicated this was new…and very welcome. ]]

**Process adoption.** Innovation Catalysts don't ride in like cowboys and solve everything, we explicitly show what tools we are using, facilitate the exercise, describe what situations to use it, then help teams to do the work themselves. If, by the end of the initiative, the teams haven't adopted these practices to solve other problems, we consider it a failure.

**Outcomes.** The project ended with the teams ultimately figuring out their own metrics for success, identifying the problem scope, cataloging all the possible fixes, prioritizing which ones to do, and then kicking off the development work. 

#### Results

**Tax developers gained roughly an hour of productivity back per day.** The team ultimately changed the build system in a variety of places. The work varied greatly, from light user interface changes in a small web-based scripting tool, to deeply refactoring the internals of a critical system to remove hours of latency in the software build.   

**Everyone was happy with the results.** The program drivers were inspired by the process. A few team members told me this was the most satisfying projects they've ever worked on, and they were thrilled to have finally rid themselves of obstacles that had troubled them every day for years. Best of all, people started adopting Innovation Catalyst exercises to their own team's work.

The tools we used

- The Intuit Innovation Catalyst program, in a nutshell, is an internal program to use time-tested innovation tools to improve the internal way of doing business. It’s similar to the IDEO and Frog Design approach, in that rapid ideation and prototyping are used to discover and define the most fundamental characteristics of the product offering. 

It is also heavily inspired by the work of Clayton Christensen, in that the goal is always to identify deep, unmet customer needs by understanding the jobs they are trying to accomplish and then creating the solution they want to ‘hire’ you for the most when accounting for all other ways they could try.


Our goals

You may think the goal was really to fix the build system, but the true goal was (and always is) to create a new way of teamwork that empowers everyone to fix every other problem they’ll encounter in the future.

If we’d have gone in guns blazing and ordered everyone around until we shipped a great build system, the project still would have been an abject failure. The real goal always was to reshape the culture by building leadership from within, and providing tools that enable it. Fixing the build system is just the proof that this methodology works.

So, instead of a rote blow-by-blow of the different exercises that we ran through, I’ll identify the key lessons we all learned - myself included - with each one.


- Kick off session: Here’s the problem, and here is everyone who will solve it. Every single person in this room is equally responsible for engaging, sharing what they know, and owning the outcome.

- Empathy session: We know you’re all frustrated, so get it off your chest, be heard, and rest assured that everyone now knows what you deal with every day. 

- Problem brainstorm: This system is hideously complex, incredibly interconnected, and fragile. Before we act we need to understand what we’re getting into. ‘Bull in a China shop’ won’t work. Think more like a brain surgeon.

- Root cause analysis: In complex systems, major problems often arise from multiple systems that are each functioning properly. We need to understand which ones problems are fixable, and which ones are unavoidable and just need to be planned around.

PULLQUOTE:
{{ Early on, someone asked ‘What are the metrics for success for this project?’ The senior leaders looked at us Catalysts, we looked at each other, shrugged, and one of us said: ‘I don’t know. You tell us?’ In that moment, *everything* changed. }}

- Break-away narrowing exercise: Hey, I keep seeing you in the hall, but we’ve never worked together. I never knew you had expertise in that area! Let’s grab coffee tomorrow and chat about another idea I’m working on.

- Solutions brainstorm: That unavoidable problem we identified before? Someone just though of a way to route around it so it becomes a non-issue. And every engineer that will code it is in the room and agrees it checks out. 

- Decision matrix: Oh, that one thing that I thought was really important? Now that I see the whole picture, it isn’t. And I trust why we are demoting it. 

- Final recommendations: It’s obvious to everyone here where we need to focus our efforts. We’ve done the hard thinking. And I stand by the decisions we made.


The results

By the end of the Innovation Catalyst working sessions, the entire team gained a shared understanding of the problems, system interdependencies, and possible solutions. They agreed on the highest priority fixes - and exactly why they were going to say ‘no’ to a bunch of other good ideas. And, best of all, the feedback was that this was one of the most satisfying projects they’d ever worked on, due to the level of collaboration and self-direction.

- The engineering teams ended up making a wide variety of changes to the build system. Some were as simple as slight tweaks to a user interface. Others meant deep re-factoring of core systems. 
- The new build system became easier to use, much more stable, and in some previous bottlenecks, an order of magnitude faster.
- The final result: each tax developer regained roughly an hour of productivity per day. When you extrapolate that out over hundreds of people over the course of a year, that was a huge success.
