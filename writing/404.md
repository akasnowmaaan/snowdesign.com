No Javascript V1

I'd suggest using this site with JavaScript enabled.

This is a portfolio to show off user interaction and visual design. It's built with libraries that rely on JS to do their stuff. If I had more time, I'd build in perfect progressive enhancement, but that's not what people hire me for.

IE8 + older browsers V2

Sorry

I don't support the web browser you're using.

The long explanation:

I'm not a massive company with an army of technicians that can guarantee backwards compatibility; I'm a lone designer who has a hard enough time keeping my portfolio up-to-date as it is. (The old joke of 'the cobbler's children have no shoes' is true of all but the most dedicated of self-promoters.)

If you're seeing this, then trust me - it's time to upgrade. Go get the newest version of [Internet Explorer](upgrade IE), [Chrome](get chrome), [Firefox](get firefox), or [Safari](get safari). They're free, they work better, and they fix all sorts of [security issues](browser security risk #1) that [you're vulnerable to](browser security risk #2) [right now](browser security risk #3).

Best regards.

Supporting a browser this old makes creating 2-3x more time-consuming and 10x more frustrating than just going with the [prevailing standards of backwards compatibility](google abandoning IE8). I can't afford to spend that time. 

(If this were a government site legally obligated to conform to global accessibility guidelines, well, you wouldn't be seeing this message because maximum compatibility would be a basic requirement.)
