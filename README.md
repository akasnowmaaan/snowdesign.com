This is my design portfolio website

- This showcases work from the last ten years or so
- It's main purpose is to get me a job
- After I get a job I'll explore other uses and enhancements

Details

- Built using Zurb Foundation and Foundation Icons
- Coded with Panic Coda
- Managed with GitHub (and the Mac desktop app for it)
- Images generated from Photoshop, Sketch, Marvel, Balsamiq Mockups, and Keynote 
- Images optimized using ImageOptim
